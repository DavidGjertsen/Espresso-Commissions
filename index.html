                    <h2>Special Commissions</h2>

                    <h3>Comics</h3>
                    <p>Comics are priced per panel at 75% of the above rates. For example, a rendered page with 2 busts, 1 thigh-up, and 1 fullbody would cost ($25 + $25 + $30 + $35) * 75% = $86.25.</p>

                    <h3>Ref Sheet</h3>
                    <p>Reference sheets start at $70. For that price youâ€™ll get two rendered drawings of your character in any pose, an information panel, and a color reference. Anything on top of that will be charged extra based on how complicated it is.</p>

                    <h3>Animation</h3>
                    <p>Due to the complicated and time-consuming nature of animation these will be priced by complexity. A simple loop will likely be around the same price as a regular commission, while a fully animated scene will cost significantly more. </p>
                </div>
                <p><em>Please note that the above prices are subject to change. I may also charge more for particularly complicated or time-consuming commissions.</em></p>

                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>You message me and we discuss what you would like. I provide an estimate. Once we come to an agreement, I will send you an invoice via&nbsp;PayPal.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Sketch Phase</h4>
                        <p>I work on the sketch, sending periodic updates and making changes based on your feedback. During this time you are able to cancel for a full refund.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Approval</h4>
                        <p>Once the sketch is completed I will send it to you for any final changes. Once you approve the artwork is mostly locked-in, so don't waste the opportunity to make sweeping changes.</p>

                        <h4>Drawing Phase</h4>
                        <p>I will work towards finishing the commission, sending you periodic updates as I deem necessary or whenever you ask for them. If you cancel during this phase you will not recieve a full refund. <a href="#refunds">read&nbsp;more.</a></p>

                        <p>Once your artwork is completed, I will present it for any final changes. Once I recieve payment the final high-resolution image(s) will be provided. Enjoy your beautiful new&nbsp;artwork.</p>

                <h3>What do you get out of it?</h3>
                <p>When all is said and done, you'll get a full-resolution JPG or GIF of your artwork. I will also include other resolutions and file types by request. If you're aiming for a specific resolution, let me know early so that I can plan&nbsp;ahead.</p>

                <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
                <p><strong><em>All commissioners must be 16 or older. By commissioning me you agree to follow the following terms and&nbsp;conditions.</em></strong></p>

                <h3>Changes</h3>
                <p>I allow large changes during the sketch phase, where I have the flexibility to make sweeping changes or start over without losing much progress. Once you approve the sketch and I move forward, making changes will be more difficult.</p>
                <p>Small changes after the sketch is approved are fine, but larger changes may result in an additional charge depending the amount of extra work&nbsp;required.</p>

                <h3>Payment</h3>
                <p>An invoice will be sent via PayPal once I begin work. Full payment including any extra charges must be submitted before I will send the final high-resolution file or&nbsp;files.</p>
                <p>For first-time commissioners and commissions over $50, I ask for at least 50% up front before I&nbsp;begin.</p>
                <p>In the case of non-payment or chargebacks, you will be blacklisted and any artwork will be made publically available. You will still be expected to pay in&nbsp;full.</p>

                <h3 id="refunds">Cancellation and Refunds</h3>
                <p>During the sketch phase you may cancel at no cost to you, and any payment you've already sent will be refunded in&nbsp;full.</p>
                <p>If you cancel <em>after</em> you approve the sketch, you agree to pay for whatever I finish before you cancelled. Whatever is left will be refunded, and I will clean up the unfinished artwork so you still recieve a presentable piece for your&nbsp;trouble.
